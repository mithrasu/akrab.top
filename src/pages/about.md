## About

Hello! I'm **[Mithras](https://akrab.top)**, a backend developer and Open-Source enthusiast from Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

- Two years working experience in cloud native platform development.
- Some experience with Java, Python and Go.
- Experiments with new technologies and languages (like Rust, AI!).

Outside of programming, I indulge in moviesðŸŽ¬ and readingðŸ“š. You can view my movie-watching and reading history from [NeoDB](https://neodb.social/users/mithrasu/). And I will also share some thoughts about movies and reading here as well.
